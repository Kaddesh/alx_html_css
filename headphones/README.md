This project is following the HTML and css, advanced project that includes responsive designs

This project practically test the use of both relative and absolute values for responsiveness, it strengthens HTML structure workflow

I learnt and refreshed my knowledge on how animation can be implemented without third libraries

The take home for me is the use of clip path in CSS to build an hexagon, this serves as a reminder that nothing is impossible, everything just needs creativity.
